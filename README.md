# AI-Chatbot-for-FAQ-s
AI FAQ Chatbot (Rule-Based) This project is a simple FAQ chatbot built using Python and Flask. It accepts a user’s input and returns answers from a predefined FAQ list stored in a JSON file. The chatbot is designed to respond instantly to commonly asked questions related to AI, based on the limited dataset I created.
